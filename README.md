Modified based on dfaour's project: https://github.com/dfaour/downloadPanopto

### To Use
1. Copy the entire contents of downloader.js
2. In your favourite browser (tested: Google Chrome and Firefox, but should work in any modern browser with JavaScript enabled), create a new bookmark and paste the code you copied into 'URL' of the bookmark (name can be anything).
3. After saving the bookmark, while you are on the panopto video site, click on the bookmark, and you will be directed to a separate page containing .mp4 file for that panopto video.
4. Download the .mp4 file and you are all set!
